I've been involved in WIT for 2 years, and plan to continue for many more. Admittedly, I'm an avid binge watcher, food enthusiast, and insomniac.

I had a great, refreshing experience being in the club last year and I hope to continue motivating and inspiring club members in computer science for the next two years at Tino. In the rare cases where I have freedom and free time, I like to immerse myself in music, dramas, or a good book. Don't be afraid to approach me and ask me any questions! (I don't byte.)"},

Outside of school, I enjoy playing basketball and badminton, hiking, volunteering, sketching animals, and reading novels.
